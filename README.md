ðŸš€ I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer, interested in working with LLM and GenerativeAI.

- First-ever implementation of a talking avatar and transformer-based predictive AI pipeline using kafka-Pyspark during the Oman Shura Election 2023.
- Proven track record in developing large-scale models such as Stable Video Diffusion, Large Language Models (LLMs), lip-sync, text-to-image, and speech-to-text (STT) systems.
- Extensive experience with developing large models on GPU clusters using large datasets, including multinode and multi-GPU configurations with A100 and H100 GPUs.
- Highly proficient in PyTorch and distributed training libraries such as Accelerate and DeepSpeed.
